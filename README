This project goes in gitlab and gives a KPI with all the commits that happened per Functional Element


-> Every top hostgroup lvl does not have the same Functional Element as its children so we had to do a lot of puppetdb querys
   to get each hostgroup's F.E.


--Documentation--


get_ammount_of_commits :
    The projects get an argument on how many hours you want it to look but.
    For example : ./gitlab_activity 1  = gets the activity for the last hour

    Here gets the commits that happened in gitlab 



parse_arguments : 
   Creating the argument for the hours that was mentioned above


projects_generator:
   gets the full project: node , environmetn, name etc

gitlab_paginated_request:
   pagination divides large list of items in pages. This is what we are also doing right now for the projects


def send(document)
   sends the KPI to the monitoring's infrustractor endpoint 


def main()
   ->gets the ammount with the hours there
   ->the project name goes like this 'it-cm-lcs' and we are getting only the last part witch is the hostgroup name
   -> we are doing a puppetdb query to get top-level-hostgroup's name 
   -> Every child of the top level hostgroup does not have the same functional element. This is why for every top level hostgroup we are 
      doing on more puppetdb query for all the children nodes of the top lvl hostgroup
      to get the Functional Element of every node
   -> we are having a list of dictionaries and we are creating a new one with keys the Functional Element and as Value to commits that happened
   -> creating a KPI and sending it to the endpoint that was mentioned earlier


This project had the problem of doing way to many puppetdb querys ( over 40.000 ).We decided to get the functional element of the top level hostgroup only
That needed a limit to the querys so it could stop at the first node that it would find
This connected me to another project that i should fix that bug on the puppetdb client , creating room for more parameters

So this would allow us to have as hostgroup endpoint = /pdb/query/v4/facts/hostgroup?limit=0&offset=0 (offset not needed at this project)
